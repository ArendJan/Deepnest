# Contributing

Just follow the usual github work-flows.

- **Issues** are code-related, usually leading to an action
- **Discussions** are used for ideas, questions etc. (things are more casual)

## Maintainers

- keep instructions minimal (assume the target-audience knows what they're doing)
- do not close issues or PRs lightly. Ideally, the authors will close themselves.
- prefer cli reproducers
